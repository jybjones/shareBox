# [Sh@reBox](http://sharebox-capstone.herokuapp.com/#!/) is [online](http://sharebox-capstone.herokuapp.com/#!/)!


Sh@rebox is an easy and safe way to lend, borrow, or trade items with local residents and friends in your area. Through a set of localized smart pods, modular storage spaces are filled with __insert awesome stuff here__. The online platform manages the inventory and keeps the process transparent and efficient, so sharing can be second nature. Got a slow cooker you used once for a party thatâ€™s now taking up space? Add it to Sh@rebox and allow your neighbors to use it too!

Sh@rebox exists to help people make better use of what they already have by sharing items with nearby neighbors and friends that would otherwise go unused.
